In Non-nested mode Kubernetes cluster is provisioned side by side with Openstack cluster with networking provided by same Contrail controller.

# __Prerequisites__

1. Installed and running Contrail Openstack cluster on either Bare Metal server (or Virtual Machine).
   This cluster should be based on Contrail 5.0 release.

2. Installed and running Kubernetes cluster on same Bare Metal server (or Virtual Machine) as used in step 1.

3. Label the above node (where Contrail controller is running) using following:

```
       kubectl label node <node> node-role.opencontrail.org/controller=true
```

4. Kubelet running on the Kubernetes master should NOT be configured with network plugin.
      Ensure that Kubelet running on the kubernetes master node is not run with network plugin options. If kubelet is running with network plugin option, then:
```
       Disable/comment out the KUBELET_NETWORK_ARGS option in the configuration file:
       /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf

       Restart kubelet service:
       systemctl daemon-reload; systemctl restart kubelet.service       
```

5. Provision additional worker Kubernetes virtual machines (with CentOS 7.5 OS) and join them to the Kubernetes cluster provisioned above.

# __Provision__
Follow these steps to provision Contrail Kubernetes cluster side   

1. Clone contrail-container-build repo in any server of your choice.
```
       git clone https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-container-builder.git
```

2. Populate common.env file (located in the top directory of the cloned contrail-container-builder repo) with info corresponding to your cluster and environment.

For you reference, please find a sample common.env file with required bare minimum configurations here:

https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-container-builder/blob/master/kubernetes/sample_config_files/common.env.sample.nested_mode

           a. Remove KUBEMANAGER_NESTED_MODE macro when using this sample file as the base.
           b. Optionally remove AUTH_MODE and subsequent keystone macros if not used.

3. Generate the yaml file as following:
```
       cd <your contrail-container-build-repo>/kubernetes/manifests

       ./resolve-manifest.sh contrail-non-nested-kubernetes.yaml  > non-nested-contrail.yml
```
4. If any of the macros are not specified in common.env, they will have empty string assignments in the "env" ConfigMap in the generated yaml. Make sure such empty macros are removed from the yaml.
   
5. Copy over the file generated from Step 3 to the master node in your Kubernetes cluster.

6. Create contrail components as pods on the Kubernetes cluster, as follows:

```
       kubectl apply -f non-nested-contrail.yml
```
7. Following Contrail pods should be created on the Kubernetes cluster. Notice that contrail-agent pod is created only on the worker node.
```
       [root@b4s403 manifests]# kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
       NAMESPACE     NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP              NODE
       kube-system   contrail-agent-mxkcq             2/2       Running   0          1m        10.84.24.52     b4s402
       kube-system   contrail-kube-manager-glw5m      1/1       Running   0          1m        10.84.24.53     b4s403
```
