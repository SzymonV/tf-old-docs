To force-merge a review, you need to have an account with permissions to vote Code-Review+2, Verified+2, Approved+1 and Submit. For now, this means being member of the `Project Bootstrappers` Gerrit group.

The procedure for force-merging the review is to:
* vote Approved+1
* vote Code-Review+2
* vote Verified+2
* then, the blue `Submit` button should appear. Clicking on it will merge the change.
