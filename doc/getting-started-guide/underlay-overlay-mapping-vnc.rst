Overview: Underlay Overlay Mapping using Contrail Analytics
===========================================================

Today’s cloud data centers consist of large collections of interconnected servers that provide computing and storage capacity to run a variety of applications. The servers are connected with redundant TOR switches, which in turn, are connected to spine routers. The cloud deployment is typically shared by multiple tenants, each of whom usually needs multiple isolated networks. Multiple isolated networks can be provided by overlay networks that are created by forming tunnels (for example, gre, ip-in-ip, mac-in-mac) over the underlay or physical connectivity.

As data flows in the overlay network, Contrail can provide statistics and visualization of the traffic in the underlay network.


Underlay Overlay Analytics Available in Contrail
================================================

Starting with Contrail Release 2.20, you can view a variety of analytics related to underlay and overlay traffic in the Contrail Web user interface. The following are some of the analytics that Contrail provides for statistics and visualization of overlay underlay traffic.

- View the topology of the underlay network.

A user interface view of the physical underlay network with a drill down mechanism to show connected servers (contrail computes) and virtual machines on the servers.


- View the details of any element in the topology.

You can view details of a pRouter, vRouter, or virtual machine link between two elements. You can also view traffic statistics in a graphical view corresponding to the selected element.


- View the underlay path of an overlay flow.

Given an overlay flow, you can get the underlay path used for that flow and map the path in the topology view.



Architecture and Data Collection
================================

Accumulation of the data to map an overlay flow to its underlay path is performed in several steps across Contrail modules.

The following outlines the essential steps:


#. The SNMP collector module polls physical routers.

   The SNMP collector module receives the authorizations and configurations of the physical routers from the Contrail config module, and polls all of the physical routers, using SNMP protocol. The collector uploads the data to the Contrail analytics collectors. The SNMP information is stored in the pRouter UVEs (physical router user visible entities).



#. IPFIX and sFlow protocols are used to collect the flow statistics.

   The physical router is configured to send flow statistics to the collector, using one of the collection protocols: Internet Protocol Flow Information Export (IPFIX) or sFlow (an industry standard for sampled flow of packet export at Layer 2).



#. The topology module reads the SNMP information.

   The Contrail topology module reads SNMP information from the pRouter UVEs from the analytics API, computes the neighbor list, and writes the neighbor information into the pRouter UVEs. This neighbor list is used by the Contrail WebUI to display the physical topology.



#. The Contrail user interface reads and displays the topology and statistics.

   The Contrail user interface module reads the topology information from the Contrail analytics and displays the physical topology. It also uses information stored in the analytics to display graphs for link statistics, and to show the map of the overlay flows on the underlay network.



New Processes/Services for Underlay Overlay Mapping
===================================================

The ``contrail-snmp-collector`` and the ``contrail-topology`` are new daemons that are both added to the ``contrail-analytics`` node. The ``contrail-analytics`` package contains these new features and their associated files. The contrail-status displays the new services.

Example: contrail-status
------------------------

The following is an example of using ``contrail-status`` to show the status of the new process and service for underlay overlay mapping.

::

 user@host:~# contrail-status

 == Contrail Control ==

 supervisor-control:      active

 contrail-control       active

 …

 == Contrail Analytics ==

 supervisor-analytics:     active

 …

 contrail-query-engine     active

 contrail-snmp-collector    active

 contrail-topology       active


Example: Service Command
------------------------

The ``service`` command can be used to start, stop, and restart the new services. See the following example.

::

 user@host:~# service contrail-snmp-collector status

 contrail-snmp-collector     RUNNING  pid 12179, uptime 1 day, 14:59:11


External Interfaces Configuration for Underlay Overlay Mapping
==============================================================

This section outlines the external interface configurations necessary for successful underlay overlay mapping for Contrail analytics.


Physical Topology
=================

The typical physical topology includes:

- Servers connected to the ToR switches.


- ToR switches connected to spine switches.


- Spine switches connected to core switches.


The following is an example of how the topology is depicted in the Contrail WebUI analytics.

.. _Figure 59: 

*Figure 59* : Analytics Topology

.. figure:: s042103.gif


SNMP Configuration
==================

Configure SNMP on the physical devices so that the ``contrail-snmp-collector`` can read SNMP data.

The following shows an example SNMP configuration from a Juniper Networks device.

``set snmp community public authorization read-only`` 


Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) Configuration
==================================================

Configure LLDP on the physical device so that the ``contrail-snmp-collector`` can read the neighbor information of the routers.

The following is an example of LLDP configuration on a Juniper Networks device.

``set protocols lldp interface all`` 

``set protocols lldp-med interface all`` 


IPFIX and sFlow Configuration
=============================

Flow samples are sent to the ``contrail-collector`` by the physical devices. Because the ``contrail-collector`` supports the sFlow and IPFIX protocols for receiving flow samples, the physical devices, such as MX Series devices or ToR switches, must be configured to send samples using one of those protocols.

Example: sFlow Configuration
----------------------------

The following shows a sample sFlow configuration. In the sample, the IP variable *<source ip>* refers to the loopback or IP that can be reachable of the device that acts as an sflow source, and the other IP variable *<collector_IP_data>* is the address of the collector device.

::

 root@host> show configuration protocols sflow | display set

 set protocols sflow polling-interval 0

 set protocols sflow sample-rate ingress 10

 set protocols sflow source-ip <source ip>4

 set protocols sflow collector <collector_IP_data>  udp-port 6343

 set protocols sflow interfaces ge-0/0/0.0

 set protocols sflow interfaces ge-0/0/1.0

 set protocols sflow interfaces ge-0/0/2.0

 set protocols sflow interfaces ge-0/0/3.0

 set protocols sflow interfaces ge-0/0/4.0


Example: IPFIX Configuration
----------------------------

The following is a sample IPFIX configuration from a Juniper Networks device. The IP address variable *<ip_sflow collector>* represents the sflow collector (control-collector analytics node) and *<source ip>* represents the source (outgoing) interface on the router/switch device used for sending flow data to the collector. This could also be the lo0 address, if it s reachable from the Contrail cluster.

::

 set forwarding-options sampling instance sample-ins1 family inet output inline-jflow source-address <source ip>


Sending pRouter Information to the SNMP Collector in Contrail
=============================================================

Information about the physical devices must be sent to the SNMP collector before the full analytics information can be read and displayed. Typically, the pRouter information is taken from the ``contrail-config`` file.

 *SNMP collector getting pRouter information from contrail-config file* 

The physical routers are added to the ``contrail-config`` by using the Contrail user interface or by using direct API, by means of provisioning or other scripts. Once the configuration is in the ``contrail-config`` , the ``contrail-snmp-collector`` gets the physical router information from ``contrail-config`` . The SNMP collector uses this list and the other configuration parameters to perform SNMP queries and to populate pRouter UVEs.

.. _Figure 60: 

*Figure 60* : Add Physical Router Window

.. figure:: s042440.gif


pRouter UVEs
============

pRouter UVEs are accessed from the REST APIs on your system from ``contrail-analytics-api`` , using a URL of the form:

``http://<host ip>:8081/analytics/uves/prouters`` 

The following is sample output from a pRouter REST API:

.. _Figure 61: 

*Figure 61* : Sample Output From a pRouter REST API

.. figure:: s042104.gif

Details of a pRouter UVE can be obtained from your system, using a URL of the following form:

``http://<host ip>:8081/analytics/uves/prouter/a7-ex3?flat`` 

The following is sample output of a pRouter UVE.

.. _Figure 62: 

*Figure 62* : Sample Output From a pRouter UVE

.. figure:: s042435.gif


Contrail User Interface for Underlay Overlay Analytics
======================================================

The topology view and related functionality is accessed from the Contrail Web user interface, **Monitor > Physical Topology** .


Enabling Physical Topology on the Web UI
========================================

To enable the **Physical Topology** section in the Contrail Web UI:


#. Add the following lines to the ``/etc/contrail/config.global.js`` file of all the ``contrail-webui`` nodes:
   ::

    config.optFeatureList = {};
    config.optFeatureList.mon_infra_underlay = true;




#. Restart webui supervisor.

   ``service supervisor-webui restart`` 

   The **Physical Topology** section is now available on the Contrail Web UI.



Viewing Topology to the Virtual Machine Level
=============================================

In the Contrail user interface, it is possible to drill down through displayed topology to the virtual machine level. The following diagram shows the virtual machines instantiated on a7s36 vRouter and the full physical topology related to each.

.. _Figure 63: 

*Figure 63* : Physical Topology Related to a vRouter

.. figure:: s042436.gif


Viewing the Traffic of any Link
===============================

At **Monitor > Physical Topology** , double click any link on the topology to display the traffic statistics graph for that link. The following is an example.

.. _Figure 64: 

*Figure 64* : Traffic Statistics Graph

.. figure:: s042437.gif


Trace Flows
===========

Click the **Trace Flows** tab to see a list of active flows. To see the path of a flow, click a flow in the active flows list, then click the **Trace Flow** button. The path taken in the underlay by the selected flow displays. The following is an example.

.. _Figure 65: 

*Figure 65* : List of Active Flows

.. figure:: s042438.gif

*Limitations of Trace Flow Feature* 

Because the Trace Flow feature uses ip traceroute to determine the path between the two vRouters involved in the flow, it has the same limitations as the ip traceroute, including that Layer 2 routers in the path are not listed, and therefore do not appear in the topology.


Search Flows and Map Flows
==========================

Click the **Search Flows** tab to open a search dialog, then click the **Search** button to list the flows that match the search criteria. You can select a flow from the list and click **Map Flow** to display the underlay path taken by the selected flow in the topology. The following is an example.

.. _Figure 66: 

*Figure 66* : Underlay Path

.. figure:: s042439.gif


Overlay to Underlay Flow Map Schemas
====================================

The schema to query the underlay mapping information for an overlay flow is obtained from a REST API, which can be accessed on your system using a URL of the following form:
``http://<host ip>:8081/analytics/table/OverlayToUnderlayFlowMap/schema``  

Example: Overlay to Underlay Flow Map Schema
--------------------------------------------

 {"datatype": "string", "index": false, "name": "flow.otherinfo", "suffixes": null}]}




Example: Typical Query for Flow Map
-----------------------------------

The following is a typical query. Internally, the ``analytics-api`` performs a query into the ``FlowRecordTable`` , then into the ``StatTable.UFlowData.flow`` , to return list of ``(prouter, pifindex)`` pairs that give the underlay path taken for the given overlay flow.

::

 FROM

 OverlayToUnderlayFlowMap

 SELECT

 prouter, pifindex

 WHERE

 o_svn, o_sip, o_dvn, o_dip, o_sport, o_dport, o_protocol = <overlay flow>


Module Operations for Overlay Underlay Mapping
==============================================


SNMP Collector Operation
========================

The Contrail SNMP collector uses a Net-SNMP library to talk to a physical router or any SNMP agent. Upon receiving SNMP packets, the data is translated to the Python dictionary, and corresponding UVE objects are created. The UVE objects are then posted to the SNMP collector.
The SNMP module sleeps for some configurable period, then forks a collector process and waits for the process to complete. The collector process goes through a list of devices to be queried. For each device, it forks a greenlet task (Python coroutine), accumulates SNMP data, writes the summary to a JSON file, and exits. The parent process then reads the JSON file, creates UVEs, sends the UVEs to the collector, then goes to sleep again.
The pRouter UVE sent by the SNMP collector carries only the raw MIB information.

Example: pRouter Entry Carried in pRouter UVE
---------------------------------------------

The definition below shows the ``pRouterEntry`` carried in the ``pRouterUVE`` . Additionally, an example ``LldpTable`` definition is shown.
The following create a virtual table as defined by:

::

 http://<host ip>:8081/analytics/table/StatTable.UFlowData.flow/schema

 struct LldpTable {

   1: LldpLocalSystemData lldpLocalSystemData

   2: optional list<LldpRemoteSystemsData> lldpRemoteSystemsData

 }

 struct PRouterEntry {

   1: string name (key="ObjectPRouter")

   2: optional bool deleted

   3: optional LldpTable lldpTable

   4: optional list<ArpTable> arpTable

   5: optional list<IfTable> ifTable

   6: optional list<IfXTable> ifXTable

   7: optional list<IfStats> ifStats (tags="name:.ifIndex")

   8: optional list<IpMib> ipMib

 }

 uve sandesh PRouterUVE {

   1: PRouterEntry data

 }




Topology Module Operation
=========================

The topology module reads UVEs posted by the SNMP collector and computes the neighbor table, populating the table with remote system name, local and remote interface names, the remote type (pRouter or vRouter) and local and remote ifindices. The topology module sleeps for a while, reads UVEs, then computes the neighbor table and posts the UVE to the collector.
The pRouter UVE sent by the topology module carries the neighbor list, so the clients can put together all of the pRouter neighbor lists to compute the full topology.
The corresponding pRouter UVE definition is the following.

::

 struct LinkEntry {

 1: string remote_system_name

 2: string local_interface_name

 3: string remote_interface_name

 4: RemoteType type

 5: i32 local_interface_index

 6: i32 remote_interface_index

 }

 struct PRouterLinkEntry {

  1: string name (key="ObjectPRouter")

  2: optional bool deleted

  3: optional list<LinkEntry> link_table

 }

 uve sandesh PRouterLinkUVE {

  1: PRouterLinkEntry data

 }






IPFIX and sFlow Collector Operation
===================================

An IPFIX and sFlow collector has been implemented in the Contrail collector. The collector receives the IPFIX and sFlow samples and stores them as statistics samples in the analytics database.

Example: IPFIX sFlow Collector Data
-----------------------------------

The following definition shows the data stored for the statistics samples and the indices that can be used to perform queries.

::

 struct UFlowSample {

  1: u64 pifindex

  2: string sip

  3: string dip

  4: u16 sport

  5: u16 dport

  6: u16 protocol

  7: u16 vlan

  8: string flowtype

  9: string otherinfo

 }

 struct UFlowData {

   1: string name (key="ObjectPRouterIP")

   2: optional bool deleted

   3: optional list<UFlowSample> flow (tags="name:.pifindex, .sip, .dip, .protocol:.sport, .protocol:.dport, .vlan")

 }




Troubleshooting Underlay Overlay Mapping
========================================

This section provides a variety of links where you can research errors that may occur with underlay overlay mapping.

System Logs
-----------

Logs for ``contrail-snmp-collector`` and ``contrail-topology`` are in the following locations on an installed Contrail system:
``/var/log/contrail/contrail-snmp-collector-stdout.log`` 
``/var/log/contrail/contrail-topology.log`` 

Introspect Utility
------------------

Use URLs of the following forms on your Contrail system to access the introspect utilities for SNMP data and for topology data.
- SNMP data introspect

``http://<host ip>:5920/Snh_SandeshUVECacheReq?x=PRouterEntry``  

- Topology data introspect

``http://<host ip>:5921/Snh_SandeshUVECacheReq?x=PRouterLinkEntry`` 


Script to add pRouter Objects
=============================

The usual mechanism for adding pRouter objects to ``contrail-config`` is through Contrail UI. But you also have the ability to add these objects using the Contrail ``vnc-api`` . To add one pRouter, save the file with the name ``cfg-snmp.py`` , and then execute the command as shown:
``python cfg-snmp.py`` 

Example: Content for cfg-snmp.py
--------------------------------


::

 #!python

 from vnc_api import vnc_api

 from vnc_api.gen.resource_xsd import SNMPCredentials



 vnc = vnc_api.VncApi('admin', 'abcde123', 'admin')

 apr = vnc_api.gen.resource_client.PhysicalRouter(name='a7-mx80-1')

 apr.set_physical_router_management_ip('ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_dataplane_ip(''ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_snmp_credentials(SNMPCredentials(version=2, v2_community='public'))

 vnc.physical_router_create(apr)

 #$ABC123

 apr = vnc_api.gen.resource_client.PhysicalRouter(name='a7-mx80-2')

 apr.set_physical_router_management_ip('ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_dataplane_ip('ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_snmp_credentials(SNMPCredentials(version=2, v2_community='public'))

 vnc.physical_router_create(apr)

 #$ABC123'

 apr = vnc_api.gen.resource_client.PhysicalRouter(name='a7-ex3')

 apr.set_physical_router_management_ip('source_ip')

 apr.set_physical_router_dataplane_ip('source_ip'')

 apr.set_physical_router_snmp_credentials(SNMPCredentials(version=2, v2_community='public'))

 vnc.physical_router_create(apr)

 #$ABC123'

 apr = vnc_api.gen.resource_client.PhysicalRouter(name='a7-ex2')

 apr.set_physical_router_management_ip('ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_dataplane_ip('ip_address')

 apr.set_physical_router_snmp_credentials(SNMPCredentials(version=2, v2_community='public'))

 vnc.physical_router_create(apr)

 #$ABC123'
