Service Chaining
================

Contrail Controller supports chaining of various Layer 2 through Layer 7 services such as firewall, NAT, IDP, and so on.

-  `Service Chaining Configuration Elements`_ 



Service Chaining Basics
=======================

Services are offered by instantiating service virtual machines to dynamically apply single or multiple services to virtual machine (VM) traffic. It is also possible to chain physical appliance-based services.

 `Figure 51`_ shows the basic service chain schema, with a single service. The service VM spawns the service, using the convention of left interface (left IF) and right interface (right IF). Multiple services can also be chained together.

When you create a service chain, the Contrail software creates tunnels across the underlay network that span through all services in the chain. `Figure 52`_ shows two end points and two compute nodes, each with one service instance and traffic going to and from one end point to the other.

The following are the modes of services that can be configured.

-  *Transparent or bridge mode* 

 - Used for services that do not modify the packet. Also known as bump-in-the-wire or Layer 2 mode. Examples include Layer 2 firewall, IDP, and so on.



-  *In-network or routed mode* 

 - Provides a gateway service where packets are routed between the service instance interfaces. Examples include NAT, Layer 3 firewall, load balancer, HTTP proxy, and so on.



-  *In-network-nat mode* 

 - Similar to in-network mode, however, return traffic does not need to be routed to the source network. In-network-nat mode is particularly useful for NAT service.




Service Chaining Configuration Elements
=======================================

Service chaining requires the following configuration elements in the solution:

- Service template


- Service instance


- Service policy


*Service Template* 

Service templates are always configured in the scope of a domain, and the templates can be used on all projects within a domain. A template can be used to launch multiple service instances in different projects within a domain.

The following are the parameters to be configured for a service template:

- Service template name


- Domain name


- Service mode

 - Transparent


 - In-Network


 - In-Network NAT



- Image name (for virtual service)

 - If the service is a virtual service, then the name of the image to be used must be included in the service template. In an OpenStack setup, the image must be added to the setup by using Glance.



- Interface list

 - Ordered list of interfaces---this determines the order in which Interfaces will be created on the service instance.


 - Most service templates will have management, left, and right interfaces. For service instances requiring more interfaces, “other” interfaces can be added to the interface list.


 - Shared IP attribute, per interface


 - Static routes enabled attribute, per interface



 - Advanced options

 - Service scaling— use this attribute to enable a service instance to have more than one instance of the service instance virtual machine.


 - Flavor—assign an OpenStack flavor to be used while launching the service instance. Flavors are defined in OpenStack Nova with attributes such as assignments of CPU cores, memory, and disk space.



*Service Instance* 

A service instance is always maintained within the scope of a project. A service instance is launched using a specified service template from the domain to which the project belongs.

The following are the parameters to be configured for a service instance:

- Service instance name


- Project name


- Service template name


- Number of virtual machines that will be spawned

 - Enable service scaling in the service template for multiple virtual machines



- Ordered virtual network list

  - Interfaces listed in the order specified in the service template


  - Identify virtual network for each interface


  - Assign static routes for virtual networks that have static route enabled in the service template for their interface

    - Traffic that matches an assigned static route is directed to the service instance on the interface created for the corresponding virtual network




*Service Policy* 

The following are the parameters to be configured for a service policy:

- Policy name


- Source network name


- Destination network name


- Other policy match conditions, for example direction and source and destination ports


- Policy configured in “routed/in-network” or “bridged/” mode


- An action type called **apply_service** is used:

  - Example: **'apply_service’: [DomainName:ProjectName:ServiceInstanceName]**
