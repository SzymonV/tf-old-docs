System Log Receiver in Contrail Analytics
=========================================

-  `Redirecting System Logs to Contrail Collector`_ 


-  `Exporting Logs from Contrail Analytics`_ 



Overview
========

The contrail-collector process on the Contrail Analytics node can act as a system log receiver.


Redirecting System Logs to Contrail Collector
=============================================

You can enable the contrail-collector to receive system logs by giving a valid ``syslog_port`` as a command line option:
``--DEFAULT.syslog_port <arg>`` 
or by adding ``syslog_port`` in the DEFAULT sectionâ€‹ of the configuration file at ``/etc/contrail/contrail-collector.conf`` .
For nodes to send system logs to the contrail-collector, the system log configuration for the node should be set up to direct the system logs to contrail-collector.

Example
-------

Add the following line in ``/etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf`` on an Ubuntu system to redirect the system logs to contrail-collector.

::

	*.* @<collector_ip>:<collector_syslog_port> :: @ for udp, @@ for tcp

The logs can be retrieved by using Contrail tool, either by using the contrail-logs utility on the analytics node or by using the Contrail user interface on the system log query page.


Exporting Logs from Contrail Analytics
======================================

You can also export logs stored in Contrail analytics to another system log receiver by using the ``contrail-logs`` utility.

The contrail-logs utility can take these options: ``--send-syslog, --syslog-server, --syslog-port,`` to query Contrail analytics, then send the results as system logs to a system log server. This is an on-demand command, one can write a cron job or a job that continuously invokes ``contrail-logs`` to achieve continuous sending of logs to another system log server.
