Server Requirements and Supported Platforms
===========================================

The minimum requirement for a proof-of-concept (POC) system is 3 servers, either physical or virtual machines. All non-compute roles can be configured in each controller node. For scalability and availability reasons, it is highly recommended to use physical servers.

Each server must have a minimum of:

- 64 GB memory


- 300 GB hard drive


- 4 CPU cores


- At least one Ethernet port
