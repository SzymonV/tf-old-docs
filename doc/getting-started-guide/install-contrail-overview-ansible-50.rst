Overview of contrail-ansible-deployer used in Contrail Command for Installing Contrail with Microservices Architecture
======================================================================================================================

Contrail Release 5.0 introduces microservices architecture. This section provides an overview of using ``contrail-ansible-deployer`` used by The Contrail Command tool for installing Contrail Networking with a microservices architecture. For an introduction to Contrail microservices, refer to. For step by step procedure on how to install contrail using contrail command deployer, refer to Deploying Contrail Cluster using Contrail-Command and instances.yml

What is the contrail-ansible-deployer?
--------------------------------------

The ``contrail-ansible-deployer`` is a set of Ansible playbooks designed to deploy Contrail 5.x with microservices architecture.

The ``contrail-ansible-deployer`` contains three plays:

-  `playbooks/provision_instances.yml`_ 


-  `playbooks/configure_instances.yml`_ 


-  `playbooks/install_contrail.yml`_ 


playbooks/provision_instances.yml
---------------------------------

This play provisions the operating system instances for hosting the containers, currently for these infrastructure providers:

- kvm


- gce


- aws


playbooks/configure_instances.yml
---------------------------------

This play configures the provisioned instances. The playbook installs software and configures the operating system to meet prerequisite standards. This is applicable to all providers.

playbooks/install_contrail.yml
------------------------------

This play pulls, configures, and starts the Contrail containers.

Preparing to Install with Contrail
----------------------------------

This section helps you prepare your system before installing Contrail 5.0. *x* using ``contrail-command-deployer`` .

Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure your system is operational with the following before installation with ``contrail-command-deployer`` .

- CentOS 7.4, kernel >= 3.10.0-693.17.1


- Ansible 2.4.2.0


- Name resolution is operational for long and short host names of the cluster nodes, through either DNS or the host file.


- Docker engine (tested version is 17.03.1-ce)


- The docker-compose installed (tested version is 1.17.0)


- The docker-compose Python library (tested version is 1.9.0)


- If using Kubernetes (k8s), the tested version is 1.9.2.0


- For high availability (HA), the time must be in sync between the cluster nodes.




Supported Providers
-------------------

The playbooks support installing Contrail on the following providers:

- bms—bare metal server


- kvm—kernel-based virtual machine (KVM)-hosted virtual machines


- gce—Google compute engine (GCE)-hosted virtual machines


- aws—Amazon Web Services (AWS)-hosted virtual machines




Configure a Yaml File for Your Environment
------------------------------------------

The configuration for all three plays is contained in a single file:

``config/instances.yaml`` 

The configuration has multiple main sections, including:

-  `Provider Configuration`_ 


-  `Global Services Configuration`_ 


-  `Contrail Services Configuration`_ 


-  `Kolla Services Configuration`_ 


-  `Instances Configuration`_ 


The main sections of the ``config/instances.yaml`` file are described in this section. Using the sections that are appropriate for your system, configure each with parameters specific to your environment.



Provider Configuration
-----------------------

The section ``provider_config`` configures provider-specific settings.

  CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: YourRegistryPassword



Contrail Services Configuration
-------------------------------

This section sets global Contrail service parameters. All parameters are optional.
::

  contrail_configuration:     # Contrail service configuration section
  CONTRAIL_VERSION: latest
  UPGRADE_KERNEL: true


For a complete list of parameters available for contrail_configuration.md, see Contrail Configuration Parameters for Ansible Deployer.



Kolla Services Configuration
----------------------------

If OpenStack Kolla is deployed, this section defines the parameters for Kolla.
::

  kolla_config:




Instances Configuration
-----------------------

Instances are the operating systems on which the containers will be launched. The instance configuration has a few provider-specific knobs. The instance configuration specifies which roles are installed on which instance. Additionally, instance-wide and role-specific Contrail and Kolla configurations can be specified, overwriting the parameters from the global Contrail and Kolla configuration settings.



GCE Default All-in-One Instance
-------------------------------

The following example is a very simple all-in-one GCE instance. It will install all Contrail roles and the Kubernetes master and node, using the default configuration.
::

  instances:
  gce1:                          # Mandatory. Instance name
  provider: gce                # Mandatory. Instance runs on GCE



AWS Default All-in-One Instance
-------------------------------

The following example uses three AWS EC2 instances to deploy, and an all-in-one high availability setup with all roles and default parameters.
::

  instances:
  aws1:
    provider: aws
  aws2:
    provider: aws
  aws3:
    provider: aws



KVM Contrail Plane Instance
---------------------------

The following example is a KVM-based instance only, installing Contrail control plane containers.
::

  instances:
  kvm1:
  provider: kvm
  roles:
    config_database:
    config:
    control:
    analytics_database:
    analytics:
    webui:
    kubemanager:
    k8s_master:
