Creating Projects in OpenStack for Configuring Tenants in Contrail
==================================================================

In Contrail, a tenant configuration is called a project. A project is created for each set of virtual machines (VMs) and virtual networks (VNs) that are configured as a discrete entity for the tenant.

Projects are created, managed, and edited at the OpenStack **Projects** page.


#. Click the **Admin** tab on the OpenStack dashboard, then click the **Projects** link to access the **Projects** page; see `Figure 15`_ .

#. In the **Add Project** window, on the **Project Info** tab, enter a **Name** and a **Description** for the new project, and select the **Enabled** check box to activate this project.



#. In the **Add Project** window, select the **Project Members** tab, and assign users to this project. Designate each user as **admin** or as **Member** .

   As a general rule, one person should be a super user in the **admin** role for all projects and a user with a **Member** role should be used for general configuration purposes.



#. Click **Finish** to create the project.
