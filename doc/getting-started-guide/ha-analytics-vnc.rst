High Availability for Analytics
================================

Contrail supports multiple instances of analytics for high availability and load balancing.

Contrail analytics provides two broad areas of functionality:

-  **contrail-collector** —Receives status, logs, and flow information from all Contrail processing elements (for example, generators) and records them.

Every generator is connected to one of the **contrail-collector** instances at any given time. If an instance fails (or is shut down), all the generators that are connected to it are automatically moved to another functioning instance, typically in a few seconds or less. Some messages may be lost during this movement. UVEs are resilient to message loss, so the state shown in a UVE is kept consistent to the state in the generator.


-  **contrail-opserver** —Provides an external API to report UVEs and to query logs and flows.

Each analytics component exposes a northbound REST API represented by the **contrail-opserver** service (port 8081) so that the failure of one analytics component or one **contrail-opserver** service should not impact the operation of other instances.

These are the ways to manage connectivity to the **contrail-opserver** endpoints:

	- Periodically poll the **contrail-opserver** service on a set of analytics nodes to determine the list of functioning endpoints, then make API requests from one or more of the functioning endpoints.


	- The Contrail user interface makes use of the same northbound REST API to present dashboards, and reacts to any **contrail-opserver** high availability event automatically.
